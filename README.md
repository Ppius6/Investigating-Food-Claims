# Investigating-Food-Claims
## Introduction
This file provides an overview of a project that investigated food claims at a restaurant. The project involved analyzing a dataset to answer several questions related to the claims, such as the number of claims per location, the distribution of time taken to settle claims, and the relationship between time to close a case and amount paid.

## Project Overview
The project began with an inspection of the dataset to check the data types and shape of the dataframe. The missing values in the amount_paid column were replaced with the median of the column, and the missing values in the linked_cases column were replaced with False.

The project then focused on answering four questions using visualizations:

1. Number of Claims per Location: A bar plot was created to show the number of claims per location. The visualization indicated that RECIFE had the highest number of claims per location.

2. Distribution of Time Taken to Settle Claims: A histogram was created to show the distribution of time taken to settle claims. The visualization indicated that it took an average of 180 days to settle most claims.

3. Relationship Between Time to Close and Locations: A scatterplot was created to investigate the relationship between time to close a claim and locations. The visualization indicated that it took less time to close claims in NATAL, the most time in SAO LUIS, and FORTALEZA had the least time to close a claim.

4. Relationship Between Time to Close and Amount Paid: A scatterplot was created to investigate the relationship between the time to close a case and the amount paid. The visualization indicated a positive correlation between the time to close a case and the amount paid, suggesting that claims that took longer to close tended to have a higher amount paid.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of analyzing data to uncover insights and trends that can help identify potential issues and opportunities for improvement. By investigating food claims at a restaurant, the project provides valuable information that can help the restaurant to better manage its claims process and improve customer satisfaction.
